          <h1>Indian Language</h1>
          <p>India is the home of a very large number of languages. In fact, so many languages and dialects are spoken in India that it is often described as a ‘museum of languages’. The language diversity is by all means baffling. In popular parlance it is often described as ‘linguistic pluralism’. But this may not be a correct description. The prevailing situation in the country is not pluralistic but that of a continuum. One dialect merges into the other almost imperceptibly; one language replaces the other gradually. Moreover, along the line of contact between two languages, there is a zone of transition in which people are bilingual.<br>Thus lan­guages do not exist in water-tight compartments. While linguistic pluralism is a state of mutual existence of several languages in a con­tiguous space, it does not preclude the possibility of inter-connections between one language and the other. In fact, these links have grown over millennia of shared history. While linguistic pluralism continues to be a distinctive feature of the modern Indian state, it will be wrong to assume that there has been no interaction between the different groups.</br>India’s heritage in languages and literature is one of the richest in the world. Some of the languages that were spoken in India in ancient times and had a rich literature have become extinct, others remained important.<br>As Sanskrit is no longer a spoken language, it is still a language of many religious rituals and of literature. The old languages have left their mark on the other languages which we speak today.</br></p>
